# MCP Checkpoint Server Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert the existing checkpoint implementation into a complete MCP server that provides "time travel" functionality for AI agent sessions. Users can create checkpoints, view timeline, and rollback to previous states.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current State
- **Existing**: Complete checkpoint logic in `/checkpoint/` folder
- **Reference**: Working MCP memory server in `/memory/` folder
- **Need**: MCP server wrapper to expose checkpoint functionality as tools

### Target Architecture

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. **Create MCP server structure** (based on memory server)
   - Copy memory server structure as template
   - Update package.json with checkpoint server details
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Create Dockerfile for containerization

2. **Adapt existing checkpoint code**
   - Copy checkpoint implementation to new structure
   - Remove VS Code dependencies (vscode import)
   - Replace VS Code workspace API with file system operations
   - Update telemetry/logging to be MCP-compatible

### Phase 2: MCP Tools Implementation
Define 5 core MCP tools that agents can use:

1. **create_checkpoint**
   - Input: `message` (optional description)
   - Output: `checkpointId`, `timestamp`, `filesChanged`
   - Creates a new checkpoint of current state

2. **show_timeline**
   - Input: None
   - Output: Array of checkpoints with `id`, `timestamp`, `message`, `filesChanged`
   - Shows chronological list of all checkpoints

3. **rollback_checkpoint**
   - Input: `checkpointId`
   - Output: `success`, `filesRestored`, `message`
   - Restores workspace to specified checkpoint state

4. **show_diff**
   - Input: `fromCheckpoint`, `toCheckpoint` (optional, defaults to current)
   - Output: Array of file changes with `path`, `before`, `after`
   - Shows differences between checkpoints

5. **checkpoint_status**
   - Input: None
   - Output: `currentCheckpoint`, `totalCheckpoints`, `workspaceHash`
   - Shows current checkpoint system status

### Phase 3: Core Adaptations

#### 3.1 Remove VS Code Dependencies
- Replace `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` with process.cwd() or environment variable
- Remove VS Code telemetry service
- Replace VS Code file system APIs with Node.js fs/promises
- Update error handling for CLI environment

#### 3.2 Environment Configuration
- Add environment variables for configuration:
  - `CHECKPOINT_WORKSPACE_PATH` - Target workspace directory
  - `CHECKPOINT_STORAGE_PATH` - Storage location for shadow git repos
  - `CHECKPOINT_EXCLUSIONS_FILE` - Custom exclusions file (optional)

#### 3.3 Persistence and State Management
- Implement checkpoint metadata storage (JSON file)
- Track checkpoint history with timestamps and descriptions
- Handle workspace validation and initialization
- Implement cleanup and maintenance operations

### Phase 4: Integration Features

#### 4.1 Enhanced Timeline Display
- Format timeline output for CLI consumption
- Add file change counts and summaries
- Include checkpoint descriptions/messages
- Show time differences between checkpoints

#### 4.2 Smart Diff Generation
- Implement syntax-aware diff output
- Support for different output formats (unified, side-by-side)
- Filter diffs by file types or patterns
- Summarize changes at high level

#### 4.3 Safety and Validation
- Workspace validation (not in protected directories)
- Git repository detection and conflict prevention
- Backup critical files before rollback operations
- Implement rollback confirmation and undo

### Phase 5: Installation and Configuration

#### 5.1 NPM Package
- Publish as `@modelcontextprotocol/server-checkpoint`
- Include CLI binary for direct execution
- Support both NPX and Docker installation methods

#### 5.2 Docker Support
- Multi-stage build for optimal image size
- Volume mounting for workspace and storage
- Environment variable configuration
- Health checks and logging

#### 5.3 Claude Desktop Integration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-checkpoint"],
      "env": {
        "CHECKPOINT_WORKSPACE_PATH": "/path/to/workspace",
        "CHECKPOINT_STORAGE_PATH": "/path/to/storage"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### File System Operations
- Use Node.js fs/promises for all file operations
- Implement proper error handling for permission issues
- Support cross-platform path operations
- Handle symbolic links and special files appropriately

### Git Operations
- Maintain existing simple-git usage
- Ensure git availability validation
- Handle git configuration and credentials
- Support different git versions and configurations

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of checkpoint data
- Streaming for large file operations
- Efficient diff algorithms for large changes
- Background cleanup of old checkpoints

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for users
- Graceful degradation when git unavailable
- Recovery from corrupted checkpoint data
- Clear error reporting to MCP clients

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for core checkpoint operations
2. Integration tests with MCP protocol
3. End-to-end tests with Claude Desktop
4. Performance tests with large repositories
5. Error scenario testing (permissions, disk space, etc.)

## Documentation
1. Update README with installation and usage instructions
2. API documentation for all MCP tools
3. Troubleshooting guide for common issues
4. Examples and best practices for agents

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All existing checkpoint functionality preserved
- ✅ Full MCP protocol compliance
- ✅ Easy installation via NPX and Docker
- ✅ Compatible with Claude Desktop and VS Code
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Performance suitable for large projects
- ✅ Clear documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Implement backup mechanisms before rollbacks
- **Performance**: Optimize for large repositories with smart exclusions
- **Compatibility**: Test across different operating systems and git versions
- **User Experience**: Provide clear feedback and progress indicators
